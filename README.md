# Virtual Theremin


A theremin application for Android.

## About

Virtual Theremin makes use of your Android device's front-facing camera, performing live hand motion tracking in order to simulate the way a [theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) works.

The application will adjust the dynamics (volume) and pitch of the sound being played based on your hand's position in the horizontal and vertical axis, respectively.

This project is built using [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe).
